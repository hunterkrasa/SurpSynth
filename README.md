# SurpSynth

This repository includes all of the necessary files for my Summer Undergraduate Research Program software synthesizer. 

Created using the JUCE library and coded in C++, the synthesizer initializes a plugin window within your digital audio workstation (DAW) of choice. This window includes basic controls for the synthesizer application, including different options for wave types and attack, decay, sustain, release (ADSR) values. It also includes a large gain meter.

To use, the source code must be run using JUCE-- the VST files are not included here. This repository is purely for the code.
